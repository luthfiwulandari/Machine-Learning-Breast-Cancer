### Built with Python, this project leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset integrated within Scikit-learn. The logistic regression model is trained to analyze features such as tumor size, texture, and symmetry to predict breast cancer status. Itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners learning machine learning or anyone interested in AI applications in healthcare.
