# Machine-Learning-Breast-Cancer

## Description
##### 
Built with Python, this project leverages the Breast Cancer dataset integrated within Scikit-learn. The logistic regression model is trained to analyze features such as tumor size, texture, and symmetry to predict breast cancer status. Itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners learning machine learning or anyone interested in AI applications in healthcare.
## Features
####
#### Data preprocessing (normalization and splitting)
#### Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn
#### Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
#### Result visualization (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)
## Dataset
#### 
This project uses the Breast Cancer dataset available directly in Scikit-learn. It contains 569 samples with 30 numeric features describing tumor characteristics. No separate download is needed as it's accessible via Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer)
