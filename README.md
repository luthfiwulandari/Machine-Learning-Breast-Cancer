# Machine-Learning-Breast-Cancer
## Description
##### Built with Python, this project leverages the Breast Cancer dataset integrated within Scikit-learn. The logistic regression model is trained to analyze features such as tumor size, texture, and symmetry to predict breast cancer status. Itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners learning machine learning or anyone interested in AI applications in healthcare.
## Features
#### Data preprocessing (normalization and splitting)
Logistic regression implementation using Scikit-learn
Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
Result visualization (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)
